# CS50-Progress
To record my progress in the CS50: Intro to CS course. Each week will be documented at a different branch. Thank you for taking the time to browse at my repository!

Each branch will have a different set of problems that I have worked on / replicated. In each Week's README, I will attach my solutions to the problem set

For CS50 Week 6, I found myself struggling a lot with Python, so I am going to pivot and do CS50's introduction to programming with Python. I will finish that and then come back to CS50x
