# CS50-Progress
To record my progress in the CS50: Intro to CS course. Each week will be documented at a different branch. Thank you for taking the time to browse at my repository!

Finally finished the project: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/839520730
Thought I would have a bit of fun with it. Took almost 2 months due to exams but I finally found the time to commit back to this again.
