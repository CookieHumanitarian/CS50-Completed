/* I had to write a program from scratch that replaces every vowel with a number. Took me about an hour as my loop initially did not work and I finally
figured out that it was due to me setting it to the arc value which would only loop once and not loop through the length of the word. This task also made
me appreciate using command line arguments and how to use them in functions. I was stuck for a bit with the syntax of using command line arguments but i 
finally go it */
