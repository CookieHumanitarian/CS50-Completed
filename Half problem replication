Decided to do a repication of half on my own as I did not understand earlier that when you call a function in a printf, you can pass it values
and later reassign those values in different names. My task was to do a replication of half where I take in bill, tax, and tip
and calculate half of that amount.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

float half(float bill, float tax, float tip); //taking in the user's bill, tax, and tip 

int main(void)
{
    float bill_payment = get_float("What is your bill? ");
    float tax_percent = get_float("What is your tax? ");
    float tip_percent = get_float("What is your tip? ");

    printf("With the bill being %.2f, the tax being %.2f, and the tip being %.2f, your share is %.2f\n", bill_payment, tax_percent, tip_percent, half(bill_payment, tax_percent, tip_percent));
}

float half(float bill, float tax, float tip) //function calculating what my half of the bill would be given the bill, tax, and tip.
{
    float a = bill + (bill * (tax / 100));
    float b = a + (a * (tip / 100));
    float c = b / 2;
    return c;
}
