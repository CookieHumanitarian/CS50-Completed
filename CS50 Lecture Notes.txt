CS is the study of information: how to process and analyses it
Computational thinking is the application of ideas from CS to problems 


* Unary - A function that takes in one argument. Unary is Base-1 meaning that it only uses one digit or bit
* Binary - A system where numbers and values are expressed 0 or 1. Binary is base-2, meaning that it only uses two digits or bits
* Bit - The smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store (0 or 1)
* Byte - Consists of adjacent 8 bits
* Transistors - Used to amplify or switch electrical signals and power. As an amplifier, a transistor transforms a small input current into a bigger output current. As a switch, it can be on (1) or off (0) to control the flow of electronic signals.
* Base x - How many unique digits / symbols are used to form a number in that system
* ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) - The most common 8 bit character encoding format for text data and digits in computers and on the internet. Note: A is stored as the decimal 65 and 1 is stored as the decimal 31. ASCII is only useful for English (and languages that uses the same alphabets). For other languages and to bypass ASCIIâ€™s limitations, we use Unicode (8 bit or 16 bits)
* Pseudocode - A simple description in plain language of the steps in an algorithm or another system
* Cloud-based - (of digital data) stored, managed, and processed on a network of remote servers hosted on the internet, rather than on local servers or personal computers.
* Parameter - Variables that we can define in the function declaration
* Arguments - Variables given to the function for execution


How computers represent numbers:
  
  

Same system as on the right. This is why:


0 = 000     5 = 101
1 = 001     6 = 110
2 = 010     7 = 111
3 = 011
4 = 100


How are emojis with different skin tones represented?
Instead of allocating a bit to each emoji with a different skintone, Unicode assigns a bit to the structure of an emoji and different bits to different skin tones. So when we receive an emoji, we get the default colour (mostly yellow) first and if the sender changes the skin tone, the computer receives a different set of bits informing the colour. 


How are emojis with multiple characters represented?
  

For this emoji, a set of bits is assigned to the left, another set to the right, and another set to the top. The device then assembles these complicated emojis using the same patterns of bits. By re-using, it saves space. 




Divide-and Conquer Algorithm
A divide and conquer algorithm is a strategy of solving a large problem by
1. Breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems
2. Solving the sub-problems, and
3. Combining them to get the desired output.


To use the divide and conquer algorithm, recursion is used. Here are the steps involved:


1. Divide: Divide the given problem into sub-problems using recursion.
2. Conquer: Solve the smaller sub-problems recursively. If the subproblem is small enough, then solve it directly.
3. Combine: Combine the solutions of the sub-problems that are part of the recursive process to solve the actual problem.
