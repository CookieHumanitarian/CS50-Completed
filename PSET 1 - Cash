/* This one was much easier than Mario. I had to write a program where given a number of cents, I had to write the change utilising the greedy algorithm.
This helped me learned about global and local variables and how a value is updated within a while-loop. 

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int get_cents(void);
int calculate_quarters(int cents);
int calculate_dimes(int cents);
int calculate_nickels(int cents);
int calculate_pennies(int cents);

int main(void)
{
    // Ask how many cents the customer is owed
    int cents = get_cents();

    // Calculate the number of quarters to give the customer
    int quarters = calculate_quarters(cents);
    cents = cents - quarters * 25;

    // Calculate the number of dimes to give the customer
    int dimes = calculate_dimes(cents);
    cents = cents - dimes * 10;

    // Calculate the number of nickels to give the customer
    int nickels = calculate_nickels(cents);
    cents = cents - nickels * 5;

    // Calculate the number of pennies to give the customer
    int pennies = calculate_pennies(cents);
    cents = cents - pennies * 1;

    // Sum coins
    int coins = quarters + dimes + nickels + pennies;

    // Print total number of coins to give the customer
    printf(" You used a total of %i coins. You used %i quarters, %i dimes, %i nickels, and %i pennies\n", coins, quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies);
}

int get_cents(void) // get user input
{
    int cent;
    do
    {
        cent = get_int("How many cents do you need? ");
    }
    while (cent < 0);
    return cent;
}

int calculate_quarters(int cents) // subtract the quarter value from cents as long as cents is more or equal than quarters
{
    int quarter = 25;
    int i = 0;

    while (cents >= quarter)
    {
        cents = cents - quarter;
        i++;
    }
    return i;
}

int calculate_dimes(int cents) // takes the remainder of cents after (any) subtraction from quarters and calculates the same thing
{
    int dime = 10;
    int i = 0;

    while (cents >= dime)
    {
        cents = cents - dime;
        i++;
    }
    return i;
}

int calculate_nickels(int cents) // copy of the above code except that the values are changed for nickel
{
    int nickel = 5;
    int i = 0;
    while (cents >= nickel)
    {
        cents = cents - nickel;
        i++;
    }
    return i;
}

int calculate_pennies(int cents) // after this stage, program will return how many coins we used in total
{
    int penny = 1;
    int i = 0;
    while (cents >= penny)
    {
        cents = cents - penny;
        i++;
    }
    return i;
}
