/* Wanted to post this as this question is one of my first forays in arrays. I had to check if a lowercase string's characters are in alphabetical order
and if yes print yes, if no print no. I struggled quite a bit with this and I know that this isn't the most elegant solution but i figured out a way to
finally solve the issue. Am quite proud so here it is*/

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    string word = get_string("Lowercase: "); //get string from user

    int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < strlen(word); i++ )
        {
            if (word[i] >= 'A' && word[i] <= 'Z') //if the letter is capitalised, subtract 32 to get the smaller letter
            {
               word[i] -= - 32;
            }

            if (word[i] < word[i - 1] ) //if the letter [i] int is smaller than letter [i - 1], add to j
            {
                j++;
            }
        }
        if (j == 0) //if j is more than 0 means that 
        {
            printf("True");
        }
        else
        {
            printf("False");
        }
        printf("\n");
