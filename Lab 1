/* Had to program how many years it took to reach a certain population given user inputs. Had everything down except the loops portion at the end. Initially
I used a do-while loop but it was inaccurate because if the user keyed in the same starting and ending population, it would return "Year = 1" when it should
be "Year = 0". Finally figured it out in the shower to use a while loop instead and it fixed the problem. Below is my code in VS Studio

Code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main(void)
{
    int start; /asks user to key in a starting population and a target population. We need a number more than 9 as the population will be stagnant later otherwise
    do
    {
        start = get_int("How many llamas do you have? ");
    }
    while (start < 9);

    int end; //we want the target population to be more than the starting population
    do
    {
        end = get_int("How many llamas do you want? ");
    }
    while (end < start); //the loop function to return back the number of years it would take to reach the target population given a starting population

    int years = 0;

    while (start < end)
    {
        start = start + start/3 - start/4;
        years++;
    }
        printf("Years: %i\n", years);
