/* Was doing the MIT Single Variable calculus and one of the questions asked me to calculate the account balance given that the
"a checking account has balance f (t) = −5t2 + 60t + 120 dollars t months into the year, and that the derivative (rate of change) 
of the account balance is given by f^1(t) = −10t + 60". During which month is the account balance greatest? What is the value of f^1(t) 
at this time? Wanted to code the solution and after a while going through a few different loops, I finally got it. I feel like I am slowly appreciating
memes stating how programmers take longer to code something than to just solve it naturally */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main(void)
{
    int i = 1; //normally i would start with i = 0 but months do not start at 0 so here's an exception
    do
    {
        int square = i * i;
        int balance = (-5 * square) + (60 * i) + 120;
        int change = (-10 * i) + 60;
        printf("Month: %i\nAccount balance: %i\nAccount change: %i\n\n", i, balance, change); // formatting the answers
        i++;
    }
        while (i < 13);
}

/* Answers should output like:
Month: 1
Account balance: 175
Account change: 50

Month: 2
Account balance: 220
Account change: 40 */
