Had to implement a basic stock trading website on my own. Took me many many hours but finally completed it and with that, I have almost completed this course.
Just have to do a final project and I think i will need another week or so. Super happy with my progress and this assignment made me feel every emotion to man
including wanting to give up and just submit half-assed work. I am glad I didn't and perservered to get all the check marks from check50

happy happy
