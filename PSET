#PSET 1 - Super simple program where i accept user input and print hello {name}

def main():
    name = input("What is your name: ")
    print("hello", name.capitalize())


main()

#2. A callback to PSET 1 where i had to print mario blocks on either side given user input. A bit fun to see how far and fast I have come since struggling
# on this 2 months ago
