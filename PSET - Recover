/* One of the toughest PSET's I have done. I had to learn all about fopen() and fclose() on my own (videos, documentation, etc). I realised that I did not 
need to specify the size of fopen() and that for sprintf() i do need to. Was quite tough and I struggled a lot. Even now, I am not 100% confident but I will
look back at this code */
