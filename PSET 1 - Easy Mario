/* Struggled for many hours on this one. I initially attempted this without looking at the walkthroughs but I could not crack the problem and eventually
watched them for a clearer idea. After watching the walkthroughs, i realised that I intuitively knew what steps to take but because i did not write them 
down, i fumbled in the dark a bit. After going into diffuse mode for an hour and coming back in the evening, i finally cracked it. I definitely learnt
a lot more about loops and how it functions on an intuitively level now. Although not quite where i am a master but it will take time. Am going to attempt
the hard mario problem now. Below is my solution:

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int get_size(void);
int print_grid(int bricks);
int main(void)
{
    int height = get_size(); //gets an integer from 1 - 8

    print_grid(height);
}

int get_size(void)
{
    int number;
    do
    {
        number = get_int("Choose a number from 1 - 8: ");
    }
    while (number < 1 || number > 8);
    return number;
}

int print_grid(int brick)//prints a grid depending on user input
{
    for (int i = 0; i < brick; i ++) // loops for return kei
    {
        for (int j = i; j < (brick - 1); j++) //prints space
        {
            printf(" ");
        }

        for (int k = 0; k <= i; k++) //prints hash
        {
            printf("#");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return true;
}
