-- More practise with SQLs with significantly more difficult. I was given a dataset from IMDB consisting and had to find a few queries

1. A SQL query to list the titles of all movies released in 2008
SELECT title FROM movies
WHERE year = 2008;

2. A SQL query to determine the birth year of Emma Stone
SELECT birth FROM people
WHERE name = 'Emma Stone';

3. A SQL query to list the titles of all movies with a release date on or after 2018, in alphabetical order.
SELECT title FROM movies
WHERE year >= 2018
ORDER by title;

4. A SQL query to determine the number of movies with an IMDb rating of 10.0
SELECT COUNT(title) FROM movies
WHERE id IN (SELECT movie_id FROM ratings
WHERE rating = 10.0);

5. A SQL query to list the titles and release years of all Harry Potter movies, in chronological order.
SELECT title,year FROM movies
WHERE title LIKE 'Harry Potter%'
ORDER BY year;

6. SQL query to determine the average rating of all movies released in 2012.
SELECT AVG(rating) FROM ratings
WHERE movie_id IN (SELECT id FROM movies WHERE year = 2012);

7. A SQL query to list all movies released in 2010 and their ratings, in descending order by rating. For movies with the same rating, order them alphabetically by title.
SELECT title, rating FROM movies
JOIN ratings ON ratings.movie_id = movies.id
WHERE year = 2010
ORDER BY rating DESC, title;

8. A SQL query to list the names of all people who starred in Toy Story.
SELECT name FROM people
WHERE id IN
(SELECT person_id FROM stars WHERE movie_id =
(SELECT id FROM movies WHERE title = 'Toy Story')
);

9. A SQL query to list the names of all people who starred in a movie released in 2004, ordered by birth year.
SELECT name FROM people
WHERE id IN (SELECT person_id FROM stars WHERE person_id IN
(SELECT id FROM movies WHERE year = 2004)) ORDER BY (SELECT birth FROM people);

10. A SQL query to list the names of all people who have directed a movie that received a rating of at least 9.0.
SELECT DISTINCT(name) FROM people
WHERE id IN (SELECT person_id FROM directors WHERE movie_id IN
(SELECT movie_id FROM ratings WHERE rating >= 9.0));

11. A SQL query to list the titles of the five highest rated movies (in order) that Chadwick Boseman starred in, starting with the highest rated.
SELECT title FROM movies
JOIN ratings ON movies.id = ratings.movie_id
JOIN stars ON movies.id = stars.movie_id
JOIN people ON stars.person_id = people.id
WHERE people.id = (SELECT id FROM people WHERE name = 'Chadwick Boseman')
ORDER BY rating DESC LIMIT 5;

12. A SQL query to list the titles of all movies in which both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence starred
SELECT title FROM movies WHERE id IN
(SELECT movie_id FROM stars WHERE person_id IN
(SELECT id FROM people WHERE name = 'Bradley Cooper')
INTERSECT
SELECT movie_id FROM stars WHERE person_id IN
(SELECT id FROM people WHERE name = 'Jennifer Lawrence'));

13. A SQL query to list the names of all people who starred in a movie in which Kevin Bacon also starred
SELECT DISTINCT(name) FROM people
JOIN stars ON stars.person_id = people.id
JOIN movies ON movies.id = stars.movie_id
WHERE movies.id IN
(SELECT movie_id FROM stars WHERE person_id =
(SELECT id FROM people WHERE name = 'Kevin Bacon' AND birth = 1958))
AND name NOT IN ('Kevin Bacon');
